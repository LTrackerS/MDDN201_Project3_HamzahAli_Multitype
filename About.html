                <p class ="PHeading">General:</p>
                <p>Multitype allows users who speak and type in different languages to have online discussions with each other in a live group chat format. 
                    A sent message is automatically translated into the specified languages of the chat lobby.  
                    Every sent and received message will be shown in the original language as well as the translation needed for each languages involved in the chat.</p>
                <p>This system breaks a barrier of communication between the world and allows masses of people to interact with each other where they would normally never be able to do so. 
                    ‘Multitype’ keeps users engaged through human interaction and constant learning of many different languages as the main driving force.</p>
                <p>Multitype is open to whoever feels like using it. Individuals who could benefit the most would be students who are interested in learning other languages,
                     and users who are thinking of travelling to different areas either for a holiday or relocation.</p>
                <p class ="PHeading">How it Works:</p>
                <p>The Chat system functions using two different API’s. The google firebase realtime database API and the Yandex Translate API.</p>
                <p>Firebase API - <a href ="https://firebase.google.com/">https://firebase.google.com/</a> <br>Yandex.Translate API - <a href="http://translate.yandex.com/">http://translate.yandex.com/</a> </p>
                <p>The firebase realtime database is used to store all messages being sent from users in the chat lobby. 
                    From storage inside the database all messages will be held and displayed for users to see while still inside the chat lobby. 
                    If a user enters a lobby, they will be shown the previous 12 messages stored in the database so they have some context of the conversation that is going on.</p>
                <p>Before any message is pushed to the firebase realtime database, the message input is taken and translated into each specific language involved in the lobby using Yandex Translate’s API. 
                    This means that no matter what language the input message is in, the displayed messages will always be in each language of the lobby type.</p>
